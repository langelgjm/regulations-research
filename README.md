# Regulations Research

This project examines three separate notice and comment proceedings: the FCC's Open Internet rulemaking, the Department of State's request for comments on the Keystone Pipeline, and the Department of Health and Human Service's rulemaking request for comments on contraceptive coverage in the Affordable Care Act.

This is a work in progress.
